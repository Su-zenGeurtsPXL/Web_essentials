<h1>Gon Freecss</h1>
<section>
    <p>
        Gon Freecss (ゴン゠フリークス, Gon Furīkusu) is a Rookie Hunter and the son of Ging Freecss. Finding his father is Gon's
        motivation in becoming a Hunter.[4]
        He has been the main protagonist for most of the series, having said role in the Hunter Exam, Zoldyck Family,
        Heavens Arena, Greed Island, and Chimera Ant arcs.

    <h2>Appareance</h2>
    <p>Gon is a young boy with long spiky black green tipped hair and large, hazel brown eyes. His usual outfit is
        composed
        of a green jacket with reddish edges covering a black or white tank top underneath, green short shorts, and
        green,
        laced boots. In some arcs such as the Greed Island and Chimera Ant arcs he takes off the jacket and wears only
        the
        tank top. In the Greed Island arc and at the beginning of the Chimera Ant arc he wears the Paladin's Necklace, a
        Greed Island card with the ability to purge any external effects to a card the wearer is holding.

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>
        Gon's curiosity takes precedence over his fear
        Gon is an athletic, rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. Also, he is not very good at math.
        However, having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he is very good with animals. Gon is an Enhancer,
        who
        are known for being simple-minded and determined. This determination and talent lead to both potential allies
        and
        potential enemies trusting in him and taking his side. He has inhuman senses; Gon has a heightened sense of
        smell
        almost like a dog's, he also has very good vision, as well as having a very keen taste. Gon wants to become a
        Hunter
        because he wishes to find out the depths of an occupation that would cause a father to choose the profession
        over
        being with his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
        Simultaneously, his flaws lie in his temper and impulsive nature. Gon sometimes fails to think things through
        and
        such actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far beyond the norm for his age, anytime his
        abilities
        are challenged, he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
        He continually strives to obtain greater power, often becoming exceptionally stronger in his anger. But Gon's
        anger
        also leads to some extremely reckless tendencies. When his emotions are ignited, Gon becomes irrational and
        completely oblivious to anything else. While his will is stronger than most and he can be very level-headed,
        this
        clear mind can also make him very cold at times. When Gon is cool-headed, it is shown that he can think very
        creatively and thoughtfully to solve a problem. The prime example is in the third stage of the Hunter Exam in
        which
        he can think clearly enough under heavy stress to find the way to get through the locked door to the finish line
        with all his companions by breaking the wall to lead to the finish line in time, which is the feat not even
        level-headed people like Kurapika or Killua can think of.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often it is difficult for others to understand or relate Gon's actions or thoughts to what people would consider
        "normal" thinking, with some believing him to be a little insane. Zepile remarked on how Gon "doesn't care about
        the
        good or the bad" when he is curious or amazed.[5] His morality is complex, almost juridical: Gon values life and
        ethics, but he can dissociate his personal feelings from them. He thanked Binolt, a serial killer, after he
        helped
        him get stronger,[6] and, in spite of being aware of how dangerous he is, Gon admires Hisoka for his might.
        Despite
        wanting to put a stop to the actions of the Phantom Troupe, Gon never hated them until he discovered they were
        capable of feeling emotion and empathy.[7] He never judged Killua for his past as an assassin, but he snapped at
        Illumi when he started to suspect that, rather than Killua killing because he was not taught to value life, his
        family was forcing him to do so regardless of how he felt about it.[8] Notably, however, he did not even think
        about
        warning Agon when the latter was about to cross paths with Hisoka, despite knowing fully well that the encounter
        would inevitably result in the man's death, all for the sake of obtaining the magician's tag.[9]
    </p>
    <p>
        When Kite died facing Neferpitou, Gon blamed himself for being too weak and entered a destructive and
        self-destructive spiral. During this descent into anger, he became extremely vengeful and single-minded, only
        focusing on making Pitou fix Kite, and if it weren't for Killua, he would've likely gotten Komugi killed. At the
        apex of his mental breakdown, he was willing to kill Komugi if Neferpitou did not accept his request and
        ultimately
        accepted to give up his own life to kill the Ant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gon is extremely confident in his abilities. Sometimes, he does not realize when the opponent is far stronger or
        even after he knows the opponent is stronger than him; regardless, he will continue to fight. He refuses to
        accept
        himself as inferior to any opponent that he disagrees with, including those clearly stronger than him. Togashi
        initially portrays this as naïveté. Aside from becoming a Hunter and finding his father, Gon desires strength
        above
        all else. Gon's greatest insecurity lies in his own weakness and not being able to protect those who are closest
        to
        him.
    </p>
    <p>
        A running gag in the series is that he often has a problem with math and numbers. The prime example is he
        miscalculates the weight of the challenge doors at Zoldyck's estate until Kurapika has to correct him or he
        misreads
        the price tag as five hundred, eighty million and Killua has to correct him as five billion, eight hundred
        million.
        It is also shown that if someone explains math and calculation too much to him, his head will release steam and
        eventually explodes like when Knuckle manages to knock him down while explaining about aura calculation.[10]

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        At the age of twenty, Ging Freecss returned home to Whale Island for the first time in eight years carrying his
        infant son, Gon. When questioned about the child's mother, Ging simply mentioned that the pair had separated.
        While Ging tried to leave Gon in his grandmother's care for a little while, Ging's cousin Mito was infuriated at
        Ging's parenting and got custody through the courts. Ging left Whale Island, never to return.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since his early youth, due to his father's absence and Mito's dislike of Ging, Gon was told that his parents
        died in an accident when he was a baby. At the age of nine, however, Gon was rescued from an angry mother
        Foxbear by a man named Kite—a professional Hunter and a student of Gon's long lost father. After hitting Gon in
        the face, Kite attempted to kill the Foxbear's cub but Gon protected it. Kite admitted to looking for Ging as a
        final test to be seen by his master as a true Hunter. Kite's admiration of Ging awoke in Gon the goal of meeting
        his father. In order to do so, Gon was driven from that moment to obtain a Hunter License, also desiring to know
        what would cause Ging to choose his profession as a Hunter over being a parent as his motivation for becoming a
        Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up, Gon was homeschooled and the only friend his age he had was Noko.[12][13] The rustic life endowed
        him with keener senses and higher physical abilities than most. As he told Kite, he managed to bond with the
        Foxbear cub.[4] On the occasions where all-female ships landed on Whale Island, Gon would take them to town and
        they would teach him "a lot of stuff".
